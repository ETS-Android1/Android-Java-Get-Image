#Android App that takes Photos in Background with AntiVirus View.

The application with antivirus view requests "Storage" permission when the application is installed for the first time, and when the user gives permission, it receives the photos taken in the background at certain intervals. Even if the phone is restarted, it continues to sync after a while. The received photos are stored in Google's Firebase.
